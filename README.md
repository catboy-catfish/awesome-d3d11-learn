# awesome-d3d
A curated list designed to aggregat some awesome resources on learning how to use the Direct3D graphics API. Mostly deals with DX11/D3D11 or DX12/D3D12.

I created this list due to not being able to easily find as much information for programming with Direct3D as I could for OpenGL or Vulkan.

I hope this helps as much as it's helping me.

# D3D 11
- [Rodolphe Vaillant: Getting started with DirectX 11](https://rodolphe-vaillant.fr/entry/121/getting-started-with-directx-11) - Original page that aggregates a lot of the links listed in this section.
