# awesome-d3d
A curated list designed to aggregate some awesome resources on learning how to use the Direct3D graphics API. Mostly deals with DX11/D3D11 or DX12/D3D12.

I created this list due to not being able to easily find as much information for programming with Direct3D as I could for OpenGL or Vulkan.

I hope this helps as much as it's helping me.

# D3D 11
## Articles
- [Rodolphe Vaillant: Getting started with DirectX 11](https://rodolphe-vaillant.fr/entry/121/getting-started-with-directx-11) - Original page that aggregates a lot of the links listed in this section.
- [MSDN: Module 1. Your First Windows Program](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/your-first-windows-program) - Microsoft's article walking you through how to create your first windows program using the Win32 API.
- [Joseph Whittington: Basic DirectX 11 tutorial, Visual Studio 2019, Win32 Window API Tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20231203194918/https://dev.to/josephwhittington/setup-d3d11-in-visual-studio-2019-423g) - Archive of Joseph Whittington's tutorial on how to set up Direct3D 11. Pretty bad. Requires the DirectX SDK as he mentions.
- [About-prog: DirectX 11 Initialization, First Triangle](https://web.archive.org/web/20211127054316/https://about-prog.com/directx11/direct3d-11-init-and-triangle-rendering) - Archive of About-prog's rough tutorial on how to initialize DirectX and draw a triangle. Doesn't cover windowing or any full code samples. Requires the DirectX SDK as mentioned.
- [RasterTek - DirectX 11 on Windows 10 tutorials](https://www.rastertek.com/tutdx11win10.html) - Thorough collection of articles on how to use DirectX 11 to make a 3D renderer on Windows 10. Goes through project setup, making a window/framework, intializing Direct3D 11, buffers, shaders and HLSL, texturing, lighting, 3D and later 2D rendering, transformation, multiple lights, sprites and text, timers, FPS measurement, DirectInput, multitexturing, lightmapping, alpha, normal mapping, frustum culling, loading Maya models, rendering to a texture, clipping planes, texture translation, transparency, particles, billboarding, depth buffer, post-processing, projective texturing and lightmaps, shadow mapping, soft shadows, instancing, hardware tesselation, deferred rendering amongst a lot more. Very comprehensive, but uses a lot of weird C++ practices, code structuring choices and design decisions. Previously required the obsolete DirectX SDK, but has recently been updated to remove that requirement and use Visual Studio 2022.
- [BraynzarSoft - DirectX 11 Tutorials](https://www.braynzarsoft.net/viewtutorial/q16390-braynzar-soft-directx-11-tutorials) - A collection of articles on how to use Direct3D 11. Deals with project setup, explains the Win32 API, walks you through how to create a window using it, initializing DirectX 11, using it to draw a triangle to the screen, interpolating color across vertices, indices, depth buffers, world view and local spaces, transformations, render states, texture mapping, pixel clipping, a font system, a high resolution timer, simple lighting, using DirectInput, a first person, freelook ahd third person camera, cube mapping, spot lights, static model loading, normal mapping, bounding volumes, bounding volume collision detection, loading an MD5 model and skeletal animation, height-map terrain, instancing, CPU-side frustum culling, billboarding and constant buffer packaging. Uses Visual Studio 2010.
- [bell0bytes - Game Programming](https://bell0bytes.eu/gamedev/gamedev/) - A collection of articles on developing a game using C++ and Direct2D 11. Tackles a window framework, DirectX fundamentals, basic HLSL shader programming, 2D rendering, Direct2D fundamentals, input handling, UI handling, a file system, an input system, programming patterns, music and sound, XAudio2, programming Tetris with the engine, physics fundamentals, basic kinematics, collision detection and response, and a particle system. Doesn't cover 3D rendering, which is unfortunate for some. Developed from Visual Studio 2017 to 2019.
- [3dgep: Introduction to DirectX 11](https://www.3dgep.com/introduction-to-directx-11/) - A large article discussing DirectX's components, pipeline, a demo and shader programming. By the end of this article you should be able to create a DirectX 11 application and render geometry using a vertex and pixel shader.
## Courses
- [Udemy, Ole Holthe: DirectX 11 Programming](https://www.udemy.com/course/directx11/?couponCode=SKILLS4SALEA) - Normally costs $39.99. Old tutorial hosted on Udemy and written by Ole Holthe. Covers more parts of DirectX than just Direct3D such as input and audio. Deals with making an example DirectX program, 2D and 3D graphics, text rendering, input devices, shaders and effects, cameras, models, audio, asset importing and exporting, and also using DirectX 9 and 10. Outdated, uses Visual Studio 2010 but also contains a chapter for converting to Visual Studio 2012.
## Repositories
- [brainexcerpts: winAPI_basic_window](https://github.com/brainexcerpts/winAPI_basic_window) - Vaillant's example of the creation of a window using the Windows API.
- [DXUT](https://github.com/microsoft/DXUT) - a GLUT-like DirectX window manager well suited for sample code or demos.
- [ImGui: Win32 setup](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/examples/example_win32_directx11/main.cpp) - Example implementation of ImGui into a Win32 DirectX 11 application.
- [ImGui: SDL setup](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/examples/example_sdl_directx11/main.cpp) - Example implementation of ImGui into an SDL DirectX 11 application.

Pretty bad. Requires the DirectX SDK as mentioned in the original article.
- [brainexcerpts: Dxerr](https://github.com/brainexcerpts/Dxerr) - Vaillant's repository for the dxerr (DirectX error library) source code which converts different HRESULTS into more readable formats.

## YouTube
- [Avoyd: RCC++ ImGui and DirectX 11 Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lOOLHmQPBU&list=PLOV2v_nVCDf5tyP3mc1G7vMb7TWVhxDIA&index=1) - Tutorial series on setting up runtime-compiled-C++ to use ImGui with DirectX 11.
- [ChiliTomatoNoodle: DirectX 11 C++ Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4FArgOX1I4&list=PLqCJpWy5Fohd3S7ICFXwUomYW0Wv67pDD) - Tutorial series on using Direct3D 11 to make a rather simple 3D renderer in C++. Deals with windowing, error handling, D3D11 initialization, triangle drawing, 3D rendering, asset importing, asset loading, HLSL, phong shading, lighting, shadow mapping, using ImGui and more. Highly informal and uses crass language. Focuses a lot more on the explanation but does some coding as well. Warning that tons of the code has been written intentionally before recording.
- [Jpres: C++ DirectX 11 Engine Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQIG77PfLgo&list=PLcacUGyBsOIBlGyQQWzp6D1Xn6ZENx9Y2&index=1) - Similar to ChiliTomatoNoodle's tutorial series, but uses the DirectXTK. Jpres doesn't cover topics like shadow mapping or advanced lighting. Instead, the series focuses more on things like input and error handling. Also quite informal but not as vulgar. As mentioned earlier, it uses the DirectXTK (DirectX toolkit) to simplify some parts of the process.
- [Matt Guerrette: DirectX 11 Tutorial Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0DPXkWsyQQYv4Zuz0nB0XN3c2MZLeycq&si=bU1Qa5KqXVj_VJa_) - Short tutorial series focusing on Win32 windowing, DirectX 11 setup, DirectX error handling, sprites and fonts using the DirectXTK and making a sprite class. Very likely incomplete or abandoned.
