# awesome-d3d
A curated list designed to aggregate some awesome resources on learning how to use the Direct3D graphics API. Mostly deals with DX11/D3D11 or DX12/D3D12.

I created this list due to not being able to easily find as much information for programming with Direct3D as I could for OpenGL or Vulkan.

I hope this helps as much as it's helping me.

# D3D 11
